This is a fan remake of the game series "Sift with Shorty". The concept of the original game was good but the controls were a bit awkward. You aim, and shoot using the keyboard while manually reload using your mouse (by dragging the magazine towards the gun).

In this remake, aim, shoot, and reload are all in the mouse. You don't need to drag the magazine towards the gun anymore. Since the controls were made easier, I made the enemy spawner spawn enemies faster. In addition, the reload screen will not appear automatically when ammo hits zero.
